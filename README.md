# regex-edit-distance

A repository with example code for the blog post http://languagengine.co/blog/regex-edit-distance/

The main file is RegexEditDistance.hs, which defines the core of the generic edit distance functionality and shows how it works. The other two files are just to define other auxiliary stuff (priority queues and regular expressions) without cluttering the main presentation.
